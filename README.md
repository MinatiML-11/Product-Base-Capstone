# Smart Laundry Application
## _Themes : Tourism, Creative, and Digital Economy_

This project describes an application for Laundry Online that can connect micro laundry businesses with customers where they can find a laundry business location that is close to their home according to their needs such as if they want to find a laundry for washing their shirts, they can filter our filtering feature so that they can be linked to a laundry business which provides washing services for shirts. Also with the help of Machine Learning, customers can also get the price to be paid to the laundry business by automatically detecting the weight of their clothes. Based on the problem idea and our research from the internet, we found information that the current laundry business problem is the difficulty of finding customers, different customer needs, and a lot of competition so that our group came up with the idea of a Smart Laundry Application which is expected to solve the problems above so it can benefit both sides.

## Directory Structure

folder Dataset
|-- Image Recognition
|   |-- fabricsfocused
|   |   |-- Cotton
|   |   |-- Denim
|   |-- venv/Lib/site-packages
|-- Inception update rev2
|   |-- inceptionv3_classifier_rev2.py
|-- Inception
|   |-- VGG16_apporach.py
|   |-- inceptionv3_classifier.py
|   |-- inceptionv3_classifier_rev2.py
|-- http://34.101.45.247/api/{{requestName}}

inside the dataset folder, there are cotton, denim, and leather folders. inside each of them there is another folder containing photos of fabric materials and a text document telling what clothes the photo was taken from (but the text document was not used)
in inception2.h5 there is an accurate model that was successfully trained by us
